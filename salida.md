In general, blue hues are associated with cold temperatures and clear skies, while warmer colors indicate warmer weather and brighter days. The exact reason for why the sky is blue varies depending on geographic location, climate, and other environmental factors. However, the primary reason behind the blue color of the sky is likely a result of sunlight interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, which causes some of the light to scatter and refract into the blue colors we observe from above.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,2927,310,278,14744,470,27091,7111,373,5164,13879,1316,408,278,5253,322,1134,310,6575,4366,29892,15489,8096,293,5855,29892,322,5272,4279,29889,512,2498,29892,7254,22888,267,526,6942,411,11220,10430,29879,322,2821,14993,267,29892,1550,14294,261,11955,12266,14294,261,14826,322,11785,261,3841,29889,450,2684,2769,363,2020,278,14744,338,7254,1197,267,8679,373,1737,12122,4423,29892,23622,29892,322,916,29380,13879,29889,2398,29892,278,7601,2769,5742,278,7254,2927,310,278,14744,338,5517,263,1121,310,6575,4366,16254,292,411,278,11563,29915,29879,25005,29892,607,9946,777,310,278,3578,304,14801,322,2143,1461,964,278,7254,11955,591,14111,515,2038,29889],"total_duration":9272532062,"load_duration":10467388,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":115670000,"eval_count":133,"eval_duration":9101919000}
