These minerals are suspended in the air, which gives the sky its blue hue. The exact composition of these materials varies from place to place, but in general, they reflect or scatter sunlight in a way that creates the blue-green color we see when observing the sky at night.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,2927,10008,1363,310,278,10122,310,5164,7903,1705,322,2894,293,752,3885,29892,3704,13977,19100,680,313,1127,511,25016,17297,29872,20562,5389,311,313,9539,511,5394,22613,313,4099,645,340,511,322,2319,26999,310,916,9637,7903,1705,29879,763,4329,18467,29885,20562,5389,311,322,503,3742,5394,5444,371,29889,4525,7903,1705,29879,526,8872,2760,297,278,4799,29892,607,4076,278,14744,967,7254,22888,29872,29889,450,2684,15259,310,1438,17279,1197,267,515,2058,304,2058,29892,541,297,2498,29892,896,9432,470,14801,6575,4366,297,263,982,393,10017,278,7254,29899,12692,2927,591,1074,746,5820,292,278,14744,472,6836,12443,29873,29889],"total_duration":6510664307,"load_duration":12027689,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":28222000,"eval_count":127,"eval_duration":6426165000}
